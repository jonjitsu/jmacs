jmacs: a helper command that can load a profile


/docs
/library
Personal code organized into modules
-base.el: has basic functions / configurations to be used across profiles to bootstrap them

/packages
Downloaded packages. Currently there's only ELPA setup.

/profiles
The actual profiles. The profiles should be kept small. Most code should be in packages or lib

-test:
--TODO (profiles):
-sql editor(heidisql + workbench)
-todo system app
-orgmode calendar
-note taking app


TODO (general):
-make mini buffer file select better

-I want a hotkey for finding anything (combine find-file and switch-buffer into a sort of find-anything)
-I want the find-* functions to have a version that opens in a new window focusing on it.
-I want a hotkey that allows me to type in a todo and it will get automatically added to a list, it can be a general thing per profile where each profile has it's own file to add to.
-I want everything to have tab completion.
-I want a system where I can highlight a region and hit a hotkey and the selection gets added to a specific file. Maybe ask for which file from a set list of known files (helm style fuzzy logic autocomplete)
-I want to select a region and start typing overriding content.
-I want to set up unit testing for elisp.
-I want better quitting and returning to previous spot when dealing with 'popups' such as the help/backtrace buffers.
-Rekey resize windows + movement.
-Make emacs look decent.
